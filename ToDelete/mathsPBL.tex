\chapter*{Introduction}
Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in various healthcare applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and image-guided interventions. Accurately delineating regions of interest within medical images is essential for extracting meaningful information and enabling quantitative analysis. One effective approach to address this challenge is the use of active contours, also known as snakes, which are deformable models that can automatically find object boundaries in images. Interactive medical image segmentation, utilizing partial differential equation (PDE) control of active contours, has emerged as a promising technique to achieve accurate and efficient segmentation results.\\

In the context of medical image analysis, active contours refer to deformable curves or surfaces that evolve under the influence of internal and external forces. The internal forces promote smoothness and continuity of the contours, while the external forces are derived from the image data and drive the contour towards the desired object boundaries. By iteratively adapting the contour's shape and position, active contours can accurately delineate the desired regions of interest within medical images.\\

Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical framework to control the evolution of active contours. The evolution of an active contour can be formulated as an optimization problem, where an energy functional is minimized with respect to the contour's shape and position. By deriving appropriate PDEs that minimize the energy functional, the active contour can adapt and converge towards the desired object boundaries in the image.\\

The use of PDE-based active contour models in medical image segmentation offers several advantages. Firstly, these models can handle complex and irregular object boundaries, allowing for accurate segmentation even in the presence of noise or image artifacts. Secondly, the incorporation of user interaction enables interactive segmentation, where the user can guide and refine the contour's evolution based on their domain knowledge and intuition. This interactive nature provides flexibility and control, making the segmentation process more efficient and reliable.\\

Several active contour models have been proposed for interactive medical image segmentation. The Chan-Vese model, for example, utilizes a region-based energy functional to segment objects with homogeneous intensity distributions. The Geodesic Active Contour (GAC) model incorporates image gradient information to segment objects with intensity variations and concavities. These models, among others, form the basis for PDE control of active contours in medical image segmentation.\\

In this project, we aim to explore and implement an interactive medical image segmentation system using PDE control of active contours. By leveraging the mathematical framework of active contours and PDEs, we seek to develop an algorithm that can accurately segment objects of interest in medical images. We will investigate different active contour models, such as the Chan-Vese or GAC model, and utilize user interaction to refine the segmentation results. Through the implementation and evaluation of the algorithm on various medical image datasets, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential applications of interactive medical image segmentation using PDE control of active contours.\\

Overall, this project offers a valuable opportunity to delve into the exciting field of medical image analysis and explore the mathematical foundations and practical implementation of PDE-based active contour models. By combining image processing, mathematical modeling, and user interaction, we can contribute to improving the accuracy and efficiency of medical image segmentation techniques, ultimately enhancing healthcare diagnosis and treatment planning processes.

\chapter*{Background}
Medical image segmentation is a fundamental task in the field of medical image analysis, involving the partitioning of images into distinct regions representing different anatomical structures or pathological findings. Accurate and reliable segmentation is essential for various clinical applications, such as tumor detection, organ delineation, image registration, and treatment planning. However, medical image segmentation is a challenging task due to the complexity of image data, including noise, intensity variations, and anatomical variations among patients.\\

Active contours, also known as snakes, have been widely employed in medical image segmentation. Active contours are deformable models that iteratively evolve to delineate object boundaries based on the underlying image information. They have the ability to adapt their shape and position by minimizing energy functionals that measure the goodness of fit between the contour and the desired object boundaries. By utilizing external forces derived from image data and internal forces promoting smoothness, active contours can effectively segment objects with complex shapes and intensity distributions.\\

Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical framework to control the evolution of active contours during the segmentation process. By formulating the evolution of active contours as an optimization problem, where an energy functional is minimized, PDEs can be derived to govern the contour's behavior. These PDEs describe the evolution of the contour's level set function, which acts as a signed distance map to represent the contour's position and shape relative to the object boundaries.\\

The use of PDE-based active contour models in medical image segmentation offers several advantages. Firstly, they can handle complex object boundaries and variations in intensity, making them suitable for segmenting anatomical structures with irregular shapes or regions with intensity variations. Secondly, the incorporation of user interaction allows for interactive segmentation, where the user can guide and refine the contour's evolution based on their domain knowledge and visual feedback. This interactive nature enhances the flexibility and accuracy of the segmentation process.\\

Among the PDE-based active contour models, the Chan-Vese model and the Geodesic Active Contour (GAC) model have been widely studied in medical image segmentation. The Chan-Vese model utilizes a region-based energy functional, incorporating both inside and outside information, to segment objects with homogeneous intensity distributions. It seeks to minimize the energy functional by evolving the contour to find a globally optimal segmentation. On the other hand, the GAC model incorporates image gradient information, considering both the image intensity and gradient magnitude, to segment objects with intensity variations and concavities. By minimizing the energy functional derived from the GAC model, the contour can adapt to the object boundaries while respecting the image gradient.\\

The integration of PDE control of active contours with interactive segmentation provides a powerful framework for medical image analysis. It allows the user to actively participate in the segmentation process, refining the contour's evolution and ensuring accurate delineation of objects of interest. The combination of mathematical modeling, image analysis techniques, and user interaction offers a comprehensive approach to address the challenges associated with medical image segmentation.\\

In this project, we aim to explore and implement an interactive medical image segmentation system using PDE control of active contours. By leveraging the mathematical foundations of active contours and PDEs, we seek to develop an algorithm that can accurately segment objects in medical images. We will investigate different active contour models, such as the Chan-Vese or GAC model, and integrate user interaction to refine the segmentation results. Through the implementation and evaluation of the algorithm on various medical image datasets, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential applications of interactive medical image segmentation using PDE control of active contours.\\

Overall, this project builds upon the advancements in medical image segmentation and aims to contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient techniques for clinical applications. By utilizing the mathematical principles of active contours and PDEs, we can improve the segmentation process, enabling better diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical decision-making.\\
\chapter*{Active Contour Models}
Active contour models, also known as snakes, are deformable models used in image processing and computer vision to extract object boundaries from images. These models are particularly useful for segmenting objects with irregular shapes or regions with intensity variations. Active contours iteratively evolve to align with object boundaries by minimizing an energy functional that captures the desired characteristics of the objects.\\

There are various active contour models that have been proposed over the years, each with its own formulation and characteristics. Two widely studied models are the Chan-Vese model and the Geodesic Active Contour (GAC) model. Let's delve into each of these models and their mathematical formulations:\\

Chan-Vese Model:
The Chan-Vese model is a region-based active contour model that aims to segment objects with homogeneous intensity distributions. It is particularly effective for segmenting objects with well-defined boundaries and relatively constant intensities. The model seeks to minimize an energy functional composed of two terms: an inside region term and an outside region term.
The energy functional of the Chan-Vese model is defined as follows:\\
\begin{equation}
    \lambda\ \cdot Length(C)+\mu\ \cdot Area(In)+ \nu\ \cdot Area(Out)+\eta\ \cdot DataFit(C)
\end{equation}

Here, C represents the contour or active contour, Length(C) denotes the length of the contour, and Area(In) and Area(Out) represent the areas inside and outside the contour, respectively. The parameter $\lambda$ controls the trade-off between contour length and area terms, while $\mu$ and $\nu$ balance the inside and outside area terms. 

By minimizing the energy functional, the Chan-Vese model drives the contour to find the optimal segmentation that separates the object from the background. The model achieves this by adapting the contour shape and position iteratively.\\

Geodesic Active Contour (GAC) Model:
The Geodesic Active Contour (GAC) model extends the traditional active contour formulation by incorporating gradient information derived from the image. This model is effective in segmenting objects with intensity variations, concavities, and weak boundaries.
The energy functional of the GAC model is defined as:\\


\begin{equation}
    E(C) = \iint w(\lvert \nabla\phi \rvert) \lvert \nabla\phi \rvert \, dx \, dy + \iint g(\lvert \nabla\phi \rvert) \, dx \, dy
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ represents the level set function, which is a signed distance map representing the contour's position and shape. 

The first term of the energy functional, $\iint w(\lvert \nabla\phi \rvert) \lvert \nabla\phi \rvert \, dx \, dy$, represents the internal energy, which promotes smoothness and regularity of the contour. The function $w(\lvert \nabla\phi \rvert)$ determines the weight assigned to the gradient magnitude, allowing for customization of the behavior of the contour.

The second term, $\iint g(\lvert \nabla\phi \rvert) \, dx \, dy$, represents the external energy, which guides the contour towards the object boundaries based on image gradient information. The function $g(\lvert \nabla\phi \rvert)$ controls the sensitivity to image gradients.\\

By minimizing the energy functional, the GAC model evolves the level set function, driving the contour to align with the desired object boundaries while respecting image gradients. The model adapts the contour's shape and position iteratively until convergence is achieved.\\

These active contour models are just a few examples among many others that have been proposed in the literature. Each model has its own strengths and limitations, and the choice of the model depends on the specific characteristics of the images and the objects to be segmented. The selection of an appropriate model plays a crucial role in achieving accurate and reliable segmentation results in various medical image analysis applications.\\
\chapter*{PDE control of Active Contours}

\section*{How the PDEs can be employed to control the evolution of active contours for interactive medical image segmentation.}
The evolution of active contours can be formulated as an optimization problem, where an energy functional is minimized with respect to the contour's shape and position. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical framework to control the contour's evolution by solving this optimization problem. Let's consider the level set formulation, which represents the contour implicitly as the zero level set of a function.

The level set function, denoted as $\phi(x, y, t)$, represents the signed distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the evolving contour at time $t$. Positive values of $\phi$ indicate points inside the contour, negative values indicate points outside the contour, and $\phi = 0$ represents the contour itself.

The evolution of the level set function $\phi$ can be controlled by a PDE known as the level set equation, given by:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t} + F(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert) \cdot G(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert) = 0,
\end{equation}

where $\nabla\phi$ represents the gradient of $\phi$, $\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert$ denotes its magnitude, and $F(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert)$ and $G(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert)$ are functions that control the contour's evolution. The first term on the left-hand side ($\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}$) represents the temporal change of $\phi$, while the second term represents the spatial change of $\phi$.

The function $F(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert)$ determines the internal forces that promote smoothness and regularity of the contour. It is typically defined as $F(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert) = \alpha \cdot \text{Curvature}(\phi)$, where $\text{Curvature}(\phi)$ represents the curvature of the contour. The parameter $\alpha$ controls the strength of the internal forces.

The function $G(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert)$ represents the external forces derived from the image data, driving the contour towards the desired object boundaries. It is typically defined based on image gradient information, such as $G(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert) = \beta \cdot \text{EdgeTerm}(\phi, I)$, where $\text{EdgeTerm}(\phi, I)$ measures the intensity gradient information at the contour and $I$ represents the image. The parameter $\beta$ controls the strength of the external forces.

By solving the level set equation, the level set function $\phi$ evolves over time, causing the contour to adapt its shape and position. The optimization process aims to minimize the energy functional associated with the contour, which is typically defined based on the level set function and incorporates terms related to contour smoothness, data fidelity, and user interaction.

In the case of interactive medical image segmentation, user interaction can be incorporated into the PDE-based formulation by allowing the user to provide input or guidance to the contour's evolution. This can be achieved by introducing additional terms in the energy functional that incorporate user-specified constraints or preferences.

Overall, the use of PDEs in controlling the evolution of active contours for interactive medical image segmentation provides a mathematical framework to iteratively adapt the contour's shape and position based on internal and external forces. By solving the level set equation and minimizing the associated energy functional, the contour can accurately delineate object boundaries in medical images while incorporating user guidance and interaction.
\section*{The energy functionals used in PDE-based models.}
In PDE-based models for active contour evolution, energy functionals are utilized to measure the goodness of fit between the evolving contour and the desired object boundaries. These energy functionals capture various characteristics such as contour smoothness, data fidelity, and regularization. Here, I will describe the commonly used energy functionals with the help of mathematical equations:

Length-based Energy Functional:
The length-based energy functional promotes contour smoothness and regularity. It penalizes deviations from a smooth curve and prevents the contour from developing sharp corners or irregularities. The length-based energy functional is given by:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{length}} = \iint \alpha \lvert \nabla\phi \rvert \, dx \, dy,
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is the level set function representing the contour, $\lvert \nabla\phi \rvert$ denotes the magnitude of the gradient of $\phi$, and $\alpha$ is a parameter that controls the strength of the length-based energy term. Minimizing this energy functional encourages the contour to be smooth and have a minimal length.

Region-based Energy Functional:
The region-based energy functional captures the difference in image characteristics between the inside and outside regions of the contour. It promotes the separation of the object of interest from the background by incorporating terms related to region areas and image data fidelity. The region-based energy functional is given by:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{region}} = \iint \eta_1 H(\phi) + \eta_2 H(-\phi) \, dx \, dy + \iint \eta_3 D(\phi, I) \, dx \, dy,
\end{equation}
where $H(\phi)$ is the Heaviside function that is 1 for $\phi > 0$ and 0 otherwise, $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ are parameters controlling the inside and outside region terms, and $\eta_3 D(\phi, I)$ measures the data fidelity term based on the image data $I$. The data fidelity term measures the fit between the evolving contour and the image intensity values.

Balloon/Elasticity-based Energy Functional:
The balloon or elasticity-based energy functional allows the contour to expand or contract based on image information. It incorporates a term that encourages the contour to move towards or away from image edges or gradients. The balloon energy functional is given by:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{balloon}} = \iint \beta G(\lvert \nabla\phi \rvert) \, dx \, dy,
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is a parameter controlling the strength of the balloon energy term, and $G(\lvert \nabla\phi \rvert)$ is a function that determines the behavior of the contour based on the magnitude of the gradient of $\phi$. This term enables the contour to adapt to the image information, attracting or repelling it from the object boundaries.

These energy functionals are typically combined and weighted together to form a comprehensive energy functional that guides the evolution of the active contour. The specific combination and weighting depend on the requirements of the segmentation task and the characteristics of the image being segmented.
\section*{Euler-Lagrange equations governing the evolution of active contours.}
To derive the Euler-Lagrange equations governing the evolution of active contours, we start with the energy functional that needs to be minimized. Let's consider a generic energy functional $E(\phi)$ that depends on the level set function $\phi$. The goal is to find the level set function $\phi$ that minimizes this functional. The Euler-Lagrange equations provide necessary conditions for the minimization of the functional.

The Euler-Lagrange equations can be derived by considering the variation of the energy functional with respect to the level set function $\phi$ and its derivatives. The variation is denoted by $\delta\phi$. We seek to find $\delta\phi$ such that the variation of the energy functional $\delta E(\phi)$ is zero, i.e., $\delta E(\phi) = 0$.

The Euler-Lagrange equations can be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi_x}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi_y}\right) = 0,
\end{equation}

where $L$ represents the Lagrangian of the system, which is defined as $L = F - \frac{\partial F}{\partial \phi_x} - \frac{\partial F}{\partial \phi_y}$. Here, $F$ represents the integrand of the energy functional, which is the density of the energy at each point.

Let's consider the level set equation as an example to derive the Euler-Lagrange equations. The level set equation is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t} + F(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert) \cdot G(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert) = 0,
\end{equation}

where $F(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert)$ and $G(\lvert\nabla\phi\rvert)$ are functions that control the contour's evolution.

To derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for this level set equation, we first compute the Lagrangian $L$:

\begin{equation}
    L = F - \frac{\partial F}{\partial \phi_x} - \frac{\partial F}{\partial \phi_y}.
\end{equation}

Now, we can calculate the derivatives of $L$ with respect to $\phi$ and its spatial derivatives:

\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} &= \frac{\partial F}{\partial \phi} - \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_x^2} - \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_y^2}, \\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi_x}\right) &= \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_x^2_x} + \frac{\partial^3 F}{\partial \phi_x^3}, \\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi_y}\right) &= \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_y^2_y} + \frac{\partial^3 F}{\partial \phi_y^3}.
\end{align}

Now, substituting these derivatives into the Euler-Lagrange equations, we have:

\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial \phi} - \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_x^2} - \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_y^2} - \left(\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_x^2_x} + \frac{\partial^3 F}{\partial \phi_x^3}\right) - \left(\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_y^2_y} + \frac{\partial^3 F}{\partial \phi_y^3}\right) = 0.
\end{align}

Simplifying the equation further, we obtain:

\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial \phi} - \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_x^2} - \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_y^2} - \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_x^2_x} - \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial \phi_y^2_y} - \frac{\partial^3 F}{\partial \phi_x^3} - \frac{\partial^3 F}{\partial \phi_y^3} = 0.
\end{align}

This is the Euler-Lagrange equation governing the evolution of the active contour defined by the level set equation.

It's important to note that the specific form of the Euler-Lagrange equations depends on the energy functional or the specific PDE-based model used for active contour evolution. The derivation presented here is a general illustration of the derivation process. The actual equations may differ based on the specific formulation and terms included in the energy functional.
\section*{Numerical methods, such as finite differences or level set methods, used to solve the PDEs.}
Numerical methods play a crucial role in solving the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern the evolution of active contours. Two commonly used methods for solving PDEs in the context of active contours are finite difference methods and level set methods. Let's discuss these methods in more detail:\\

Finite Difference Methods:\\
Finite difference methods discretize the continuous domain of the PDE into a grid of discrete points. The derivatives in the PDE are approximated using finite difference approximations. The discretized PDE is then solved iteratively in a time-stepping manner. Finite difference methods are popular due to their simplicity and efficiency. They are well-suited for regular grid-based domains.\\
In the context of active contours, finite difference methods are used to solve PDEs such as the level set equation or the Chan-Vese model. The PDE is discretized on a grid, and the time evolution of the level set function or contour is computed by updating the grid values iteratively. Numerical schemes like explicit, implicit, or semi-implicit methods can be employed for time-stepping.\\

Level Set Methods:\\
Level set methods represent the contour implicitly as the zero level set of a higher-dimensional function, known as the level set function. The evolution of the contour is governed by the level set equation, which is a PDE involving the level set function. Level set methods provide a powerful framework for dealing with topological changes, such as contour merging or splitting.\\
In level set methods, the PDE is solved by iteratively evolving the level set function over time. The level set function is discretized on a grid, and numerical schemes like finite difference or finite element methods are used to solve the PDE. The numerical approximation of the PDE allows the contour to evolve and adapt to the desired object boundaries.\\

Level set methods offer several advantages, such as easy handling of topological changes, implicit representation of the contour, and ability to handle complex shapes. However, they can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional problems or for evolving contours in 3D images.\\

Both finite difference methods and level set methods have their strengths and limitations, and their suitability depends on the specific problem and requirements. Additionally, other numerical techniques like finite element methods, finite volume methods, or variational approaches can also be used to solve the PDEs associated with active contours, depending on the nature of the problem and the desired accuracy. The choice of the numerical method should consider factors such as computational efficiency, accuracy, stability, and the specific requirements of the segmentation task.

\chapter*{Implementation}

Monitor the convergence of the algorithm by tracking the changes in the energy functional or other convergence criteria.\\
Step 6: Postprocessing\\

1. Extract the final contour from the evolved level set function.\\
2. Perform any necessary postprocessing operations, such as smoothing the contour or removing 
   small spurious regions.\\
3. Visualize and analyze the segmented result to evaluate its quality and correctness.\\
Step 7: Parameter Tuning and Refinement\\

1. Fine-tune the parameters of the energy functional to achieve better segmentation results if 
   necessary.\\
2. Experiment with different initialization methods or other techniques to improve the segmentation accuracy.\\
3. Iterate and refine the implementation based on the evaluation and feedback.\\

It is important to note that this guide provides a general outline, and the specific details of implementation may vary depending on the chosen PDE-based model, numerical method, programming language, and libraries/frameworks used. Additionally, it is recommended to refer to relevant research papers, textbooks, or code repositories for more detailed implementation guidelines and examples specific to the algorithm you are working with.\\


\section*{Image Preprocessing for Medical Image Segmentation}

Image preprocessing plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality and improving the robustness of medical image segmentation algorithms. Several preprocessing steps are commonly employed, including denoising and intensity normalization. Let's discuss these steps in more detail:

\subsection*{Denoising}

Medical images are often corrupted by various types of noise, such as Gaussian noise, speckle noise, or motion artifacts. Denoising aims to reduce the noise while preserving the important image details relevant to segmentation. Common denoising techniques include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Gaussian filtering}: This method convolves the image with a Gaussian kernel to smooth out the noise while preserving edges and structures. It is effective for Gaussian noise reduction.

\item \textbf{Median filtering}: Median filtering replaces each pixel's value with the median value of its local neighborhood. It is particularly useful for reducing salt-and-pepper noise.

\item \textbf{Non-local means filtering}: Non-local means filtering exploits the redundancy of image patches to estimate the denoised pixel value. It is effective for denoising images with spatially varying noise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Intensity Normalization}

Intensity normalization is performed to achieve consistent intensity characteristics across different images or image regions. It aims to normalize the intensity distribution to enhance the visibility of structures and facilitate accurate segmentation. Common intensity normalization techniques include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Histogram equalization}: Histogram equalization redistributes the image intensities to achieve a more uniform histogram. It enhances the contrast of the image and improves the visibility of structures.

\item \textbf{Z-score normalization}: Z-score normalization transforms the image intensities to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. It standardizes the intensity distribution, making it more consistent across images.

\item \textbf{Min-max normalization}: Min-max normalization scales the intensities to a specified range, typically between 0 and 1. It stretches the intensity values to cover the full dynamic range.

\item \textbf{Non-linear intensity mapping}: Non-linear intensity mapping techniques, such as gamma correction, logarithmic mapping, or sigmoid mapping, can be used to adjust the image intensities for specific imaging modalities or characteristics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Other Preprocessing Steps}

Depending on the specific requirements of the segmentation task and characteristics of the images, additional preprocessing steps may be necessary, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Image resizing or resampling}: Resizing the images to a consistent resolution or resampling them to an isotropic voxel size can improve computational efficiency and ensure consistent segmentation results.

\item \textbf{Contrast enhancement}: Techniques like adaptive histogram equalization, contrast stretching, or local contrast enhancement can be employed to enhance the image contrast and improve the visibility of structures.

\item \textbf{Gradient computation}: Computing image gradients, such as the gradient magnitude or gradient direction, can provide useful information for edge detection or feature extraction during segmentation.

It is important to note that the choice and order of preprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the images and the requirements of the segmentation task. Experimentation and evaluation are crucial to determine the most effective preprocessing pipeline for a given application.\\

\section*{Initialization of the Active Contour and Iterative Evolution using PDEs}

Initialization of the Active Contour:

The active contour algorithm requires an initial contour to start the segmentation process. Let's denote the initial contour as $C(t=0)$, parameterized by its coordinates as $C(s, t=0) = (x(s, t=0), y(s, t=0))$, where $s$ represents the parameter along the contour. The initialization can be done in various ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Geometric shapes: For example, a circular contour can be initialized as $C(s, t=0) = (x_0 + r_0 \cos(s), y_0 + r_0 \sin(s))$, where $(x_0, y_0)$ represents the center and $r_0$ is the radius.

\item User interaction: Users can provide initial contour positions as $C(s, t=0) = (x(s, t=0), y(s, t=0))$ based on their interaction with the image.

\item Automatic initialization: Automated techniques can estimate an initial contour based on image features. Let's denote the automatically estimated contour as $C_{\text{init}}(s, t=0) = (x_{\text{init}}(s), y_{\text{init}}(s))$.
\end{itemize}

Iterative Evolution Process:

Once the active contour is initialized, it evolves iteratively using the PDEs. Let's consider the level set formulation as an example. The contour evolution is guided by the level set function, $\phi(x, y, t)$, which represents the signed distance from each point to the evolving contour. The steps involved in the iterative evolution process are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the PDE terms: Calculate the terms in the PDEs based on the chosen energy functional. For example, the energy functional $E(\phi)$ can be decomposed into length-based, region-based, and other terms. Let's denote the length term as $L(\phi)$ and the region-based term as $R(\phi)$.

\item Update the contour: The level set function evolves according to the following equation:
\[\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \alpha L(\phi) + \beta R(\phi) = 0\]


where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters controlling the influence of the length and region terms, respectively. The contour $C(s, t)$ is then implicitly defined as the zero level set of the level set function, i.e., $C(s, t) = (x(s, t), y(s, t))$ such that $\phi(x(s, t), y(s, t), t) = 0$.

\item Incorporate external forces: Additional terms can be added to the PDEs to incorporate external forces. Let's denote the external force term as $F_{\text{ext}}(\phi)$.
\[\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \alpha L(\phi) + \beta R(\phi) + \gamma F_{\text{ext}}(\phi) = 0\]

where $\gamma$ is a parameter controlling the influence of the external force term.

\item Iterate until convergence: Repeat the evolution process until convergence is achieved. This can be determined by monitoring the change in the level set function or the energy functional, such as $||\nabla \phi||$, and comparing it with a predefined threshold.

\item Post-processing: After convergence, post-processing steps can be applied to refine the final contour, such as smoothing or removing small spurious regions.
\end{itemize}

It is important to note that the specific mathematical equations and terms in the PDEs may differ based on the chosen PDE-based model and energy functional. The equations presented here provide a general framework for understanding the initialization and iterative evolution process using PDEs.

\chapter*{Evaluation Metrics}

\textbf{Metrics}: Dice coefficient, Jaccard index, sensitivity, specificity, or Hausdorff distance.\newline

\textbf{Dice Coefficient}:
The Dice coefficient measures the overlap between the segmented region and the ground truth region. It is calculated as:

\[ \text{Dice} = \frac{2 \cdot TP}{2 \cdot TP + FP + FN} \]

where TP represents the number of true positive pixels, FP represents the number of false positive pixels, and FN represents the number of false negative pixels.

\textbf{Interpretation}: The Dice coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect segmentation match. Higher values indicate better segmentation accuracy.\newline\newline


\textbf{Jaccard Index (Intersection over Union)}:
The Jaccard index, or IoU, is calculated as the ratio of the intersection of the segmented region and the ground truth region to their union:

\[ \text{IoU} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP + FN} \]

\textbf{Interpretation}: The Jaccard index ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better segmentation accuracy. A value of 1 means a perfect overlap between the segmented region and the ground truth.\newline\newline

\textbf{Sensitivity and Specificity}:
Sensitivity (true positive rate) measures the proportion of true positive predictions to the total number of positive samples in the ground truth:

\[ \text{Sensitivity} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \]

Specificity (true negative rate) measures the proportion of true negative predictions to the total number of negative samples in the ground truth:

\[ \text{Specificity} = \frac{TN}{TN + FP} \]

\textbf{Interpretation}: Sensitivity quantifies the ability of the segmentation algorithm to correctly identify the foreground pixels, while specificity measures its ability to correctly identify the background pixels. Both metrics range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\newline\newline

\textbf{Hausdorff Distance}:
The Hausdorff distance measures the maximum distance between two sets of points, representing the segmented region (\(P\)) and the ground truth region (\(Q\)). It is defined as:

\[ \text{Hausdorff Distance} = \max(\max(d(p, Q)), \max(d(q, P))) \]

where \(d(p, Q)\) denotes the distances between each point \(p\) in \(P\) and the closest point in \(Q\), and \(d(q, P)\) represents the distances between each point \(q\) in \(Q\) and the closest point in \(P\).

\textbf{Interpretation}: The Hausdorff distance quantifies the maximum disagreement or mismatch between the segmented region and the ground truth. A smaller Hausdorff distance indicates better agreement between the two regions.\newline\newline

\textbf{Interpreting the results}:

For Dice coefficient and Jaccard index: A value close to 1 indicates high similarity and good agreement between the segmented region and the ground truth. Lower values indicate poor segmentation performance.

For sensitivity and specificity: Higher values suggest better segmentation performance, with sensitivity emphasizing the ability to correctly identify foreground pixels and specificity focusing on correct background identification.

For Hausdorff distance: Smaller values indicate better agreement between the segmented region and the ground truth.

These metrics provide quantitative measures for evaluating the quality of image segmentation results. By computing and interpreting these metrics, researchers and practitioners can assess the performance of their segmentation algorithms and compare different approaches objectively.
